  "legal": "Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen für Endkunden<br><br>Brötchen.app Germany GmbH<br>Schuckenteichweg 25<br>33818 Leopoldshöhe<br>Germany<br><br>1. Introduction<br><br>1.1. Welcome to the Brötchen.app Germany GmbH app / website that is owned by Brötchen.app Germany GmbH, Schuckenteichweg 25, 33818 Leopoldshöhe (\"BA\" or \"we\").<br><br>1.2. BA's concept is to provide a digital ordering service for bakeries and their customers so that customer service can be brought to a modern level.<br><br>1.3. We offer the end consumer (\"Customer\") the opportunity to buy groceries (\"Products\") in bakeries and grocery stores etc. (\"Stores\") that are displayed on our Platform (\"Service\").<br><br>1.4. These general terms and conditions (\"Conditions\") apply to all end customers via our websites or app (\"Platform\"). Our PGB also apply to our sales partners and bakeries.<br><br>1.5. When placing an order (as defined below), the customer must accept these terms and conditions, so the customer is obliged to thoroughly review the terms before the customer places an order on the platform.<br><br>2. BA concept<br><br>2.1. The products are made available for purchase on the platform by the respective bakeries. The customer can buy the products by placing a purchase order on the platform.<br><br>2.2. The products are purchased by the customer when BA confirms this with a purchase confirmation.<br><br>2.3. As soon as a customer buys a product, the store undertakes to offer the products for sale as described here.<br><br>2.4. BA only mediates the purchase or sale of products on the platform between the customer and the respective stores and the purchase in no way creates a contractual relationship between BA and the customer with regard to the products or the purchase or sale of products . BA is therefore not responsible for the nature of the products or the fulfillment of the agreement between the store and the customer.<br><br>2.5. BA collects the purchase price (as defined below) for the products exclusively on behalf of the store and thus acts only as a payment agent on behalf of the store. The use of the platform by the customer is always free of charge.<br><br>3. Consent<br><br>3.1. By ordering on the platform, the customer confirms:<br>- To have full legal capacity;<br>- To be a consumer in the sense of § 13 BGB and to shop for personal purposes;<br>- To be at least 18 years old and in possession of a valid direct debit account, credit card or other means of payment that is available for payment on the platform.<br><br>3.2. BA reserves the right to revise and change these terms from time to time without giving a reason and at any time for future purchases. Users will be informed in good time of revisions or changes to these conditions before they come into force. If the user does not object within two weeks of receiving the notification of change, the changed conditions are deemed to have been approved. The user will be informed of this consequence in the change notification. The customer's order is subject to the conditions that apply at the time of the order by the customer, who accepts the current version with his order.<br><br>4. BA contact details and customer service<br><br>Brötchen.app Germany GmbH<br>Schuckenteichweg 25<br>33818 Leopoldshöhe<br>Germany<br><br>5. Registration and Products<br><br>5.1. With the registration the customer confirms the correctness and completeness of his data, in particular his name, his age, his payment information and his address.<br><br>5.2. The customer can only place an order after successfully registering on the platform. The customer can set up an account for this on the platform and choose a password.<br><br>5.3. The customer is responsible for keeping his access data confidential.<br><br>5.4. BA only mediates the contract between the customer and the store and bears no responsibility for the quality of the products or the performance of the contract between the store and the customer.<br><br>5.5. BA is not responsible for the manufacture, sale, purchase, storage, manufacture, production, processing, labeling, packaging, delivery or processing of the products. BA is also not responsible for the performance of the store's contractual obligations towards the customer in relation to the products, including manufacture, sale, purchase, storage, preparation, production, processing, labeling, delivery, the quality, the ingredients, the allergens or the handling of the products. Furthermore, BA is not responsible for compliance with applicable laws, including those applicable food regulations with regard to the manufacture, sale, purchase, storage, preparation, production, processing, labeling, delivery of and handling of foodstuffs, unless BA expressly states named as the manufacturer or seller of the product on the platform.<br><br>5.6. The customer can find information about the products and a description of the products on the platform. This information is only informative and is intended to enable the customer to assess selected products before making a reservation. It may happen that the platform is not updated and that the actual range of products, items in stock, etc. do not correspond to those indicated on the platform. In these cases, BA assumes no liability, subject to any restrictions in accordance with Section 15. The stores are responsible for providing information about the products and ensuring that they are factually correct and up-to-date. BA assumes no responsibility for this, subject to any restrictions in accordance with Section 15.<br><br>5.7. If the customer has doubts about allergy warnings, the ingredients or other product information, the customer must clarify this with the store immediately before ordering. The store's contact information is displayed on the platform.<br><br>5.8. Upon pickup (as defined below), the store provides the customer with information about the list of ingredients, allergens and other labeling-related information about the product. All products purchased through the BA platform must be consumed immediately upon collection and / or in accordance with the instructions on the product label or the store.<br><br>5.9. BA shall not be liable or responsible for any failure or delay in fulfilling any obligation in connection with the Products, including with respect to manufacture, sale, purchase, storage, preparation, production, processing, labeling, delivery, quality, ingredients, allergens or handling with the products, subject to any restrictions in accordance with section 15.<br><br>6. Acquisition / Purchase of Products<br><br>6.1. The customer can find a list of the active stores in the app. If the customer has allowed the app to use location services, the app tracks the customer's location and the list shows stores near the customer. As soon as the customer has selected the store and the product, he is given the opportunity to complete his order by clicking on \"Buy\".<br><br>6.2. The list is created taking geographical criteria and saved favorites into account. The customer has the option of filtering the results taking into account the availability of products, the pick-up time, the type of products or other criteria set by BA.<br><br>6.3. The stores listed in the app are those that are active on the platform.<br><br>6.4. The presentation of the store's products on the platform does not constitute a binding offer by the store.<br><br>6.5. An order placed by the customer via the platform (click on the \"Buy\" button) is considered a binding offer by the customer to the store to buy a product.<br><br>7. Confirmation of purchase<br><br>7.1. After receiving the payment, BA begins processing it by sending the order to the relevant store. BA informs the customer that the order has been received (\"order confirmation\") and is being processed. Please note that the order confirmation that the customer can call up on the platform only shows that the order has been received and is being processed and does not mean that the order has been accepted by the store.<br><br>7.2. The order confirmation should be saved by the customer. The order confirmation contains information about the order placed by the customer.<br><br>8. Right of withdrawal<br><br>8.1. Since the products are perishable goods, we would like to point out that the customer has no right of withdrawal according to §§ 312ff., 312g BGB with regard to the agreement with the store.<br><br>9. Collection<br><br>9.1. Products ordered on the platform are to be picked up by the customer at the specified pick-up address (\"pick-up\"). The pick-up time is usually 10-30 minutes, but it can be both shorter and longer. However, the order must be collected no later than 30 minutes before closing time on the ordered and confirmed day. Otherwise the order will expire. The ordered goods are then either destroyed on behalf of the customer or donated to a non-profit organization. The description of the store and details of when and where the products can be picked up are shown on the platform and in the order confirmation.<br><br>9.2.

The reviews reflect the opinions of customers who have ordered through the platform or other third parties. All statements, advice or opinions of these persons are attributable solely to them. Accordingly, to the fullest extent permitted by law, BA assumes no responsibility or liability for any reviews, including but not limited to any errors, defamation, profanity, omissions, or falsehoods that the customer may encounter in such reviews.<br><br>13.4.

BA is not responsible for any failure or non-performance of its services if this is due to circumstances beyond BA's control (without BA having at least negligently breached any related contractual obligation). These circumstances may include disruptions to BA and / or store operations as a result of changes in the law, government or official measures, acts of war, terrorism, strikes, physical obstacles, lockouts and natural disasters.<br><br>15.3. BA's liability under these terms and conditions as well as this section 15 for damage caused by slight negligence is excluded, except in cases of breach of essential contractual obligations, the breach of which endangers the purpose of the contract and on whose fulfillment the user could particularly rely.
